                    <h2>How I Chose the Best Employee Time Tracking Apps</h2>
                    <p>To give you a more specific look into how I narrowed down my list, these are the key functions and features I looked for when reviewing clock-in clock-out apps:</p>
                    <h3>Important core features:</h3>
                    <ul class="ms-arrow-list">
                        <li><strong>Mobile time clock:</strong>&nbsp;The best clock-in apps have a mobile time clock so employees can clock in and out from their phones.</li>
                        <li><strong>Overtime calculation</strong>: The app should automatically calculate overtime based on set rules or regulations.</li>
                        <li><strong>Automated time sheets:</strong>&nbsp;The app should automatically calculate employee hours and record them onto timesheets.</li>
                        <li><strong>Payroll integrations:</strong> Look for an app that exports employee timesheets to Excel or your accounting software to streamline the payroll process.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>I also checked for usability features, such as:</h3>
                    <ul class="ms-arrow-list">
                        <li><b>Intuitive interface: </b>Good clock-in and out apps make it easy to track working hours, often with just one button.</li>
                        <li><b>Remote access:</b>&nbsp;Apps with remote access are an ideal way to manage remote workers’ time, since they allow them to log in from anywhere.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>As a final check, I looked for these specific features that make for a great clock-in and out app:</h3>
                    <ul class="ms-arrow-list">
                        <li><b>Manual options.</b>&nbsp;If someone makes an error, such as forgetting to clock in or leaving a clock running, you’ll need a way to fix the mistake and edit the timesheet.</li>
                        <li><strong>Available on all app stores:</strong> You should be able to find the app on both the Apple Store and Google Play.</li>
                        <li><strong>Geofencing</strong>: This feature ensures that employees are clocking in from the correct location and is especially useful for remote or field workers.</li>
                        <li><strong>Notifications and alerts</strong>: Reminders for employees to clock in or out, and alerts for managers about missed clock-ins or early departures.</li>
                        <li><strong>Multiple job codes</strong>: If employees work different roles or tasks, they should be able to clock into specific job codes or categories.</li>
                        <li><strong>Reporting features</strong>: Managers should be able to generate reports on employee hours, overtime, late arrivals, early departures, etc.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <h3 class="mt-3 mb-0">Buddy Punch — Good break and overtime monitoring</h3>
                        <p><a href="https://buddypunch.com/" target="_blank">Buddy Punch</a> lets workers easily clock in and out from their phones using its mobile time clock.</p>
                        <p><b>Why I chose Buddy Punch:</b> Buddy Punch has a simple user-interface and offers key features like GPS tracking, facial recognition, and QR code scanning to prevent time theft.</p>
                        <h3>Employee time clock</h3>
                        <p>I like that Buddy Punch offers several methods for employees to clock in and out. Employees can use a customized 4-digit PIN, facial recognition technology, scan QR Codes, or simply use a traditional username and password for authentication.</p>
                        <p>Multiple clock-in methods are great for accessibility and security, not to mention that it’s also convenient.</p>
                        <h3>Overtime and break monitoring</h3>
                        <p>I found it really useful that you can set your own break policies based on your local labor laws within the app. You can also set up manual or automatic breaks for your employees. However, Buddy Punch only allows you to assign employees one automatic break, but you can set unlimited manual breaks.</p>
                        <p>Buddy Punch’s overtime monitoring feature is another highlight, which automatically tracks and calculates overtime hours based on the rules you set. The app will send alerts to employees when they are nearing or exceeding their regular work hours so they can clock out.</p>
                        <p>While testing the software, I could monitor overtime trends closely. This feature is really useful for making informed decisions about scheduling and workload distribution so you can better control your labor costs.</p>
                        <h3>Locations feature</h3>
                        <p>I’m a big fan of the Locations feature, which tracks where employees clock in and out using GPS. This is particularly useful for companies with remote or field employees to ensure that staff are in the correct location when they start and end their shifts. Employers can set up geofence locations, too, requiring employees to be within certain areas to clock in or out.</p>
                        <h3>Integrations</h3>
                        <p>Some of Buddy Punch’s integrations include:</p>
                        <ul class="ms-arrow-list">
                            <li>Quickbooks</li>

                        <p><b>Why I chose Connecteam:</b> I use <a href="https://connecteam.com/" target="_blank">Connecteam</a> on a daily basis and am a huge fan of all the features the time clock offers. It allows you to easily track and record your employees’ accurate work hours from wherever they’re working. </p>
                        <p>Let’s take a closer look at Connecteam’s time clock capabilities and how you can use them to optimize your day-to-day.</p>
                        <h3>GPS-enabled time clock</h3>
                        <p>With the employee time clock, your employees can clock in and out with one simple tap right from the app on their phones. You can also set up a shared kiosk on a tablet or laptop for employees who are all working from the same location. </p>
                        <p>The app offers GPS tracking so you can ensure employees are exactly where they need to be when on the clock and eliminate time theft.</p>
                        <p>You can also track employees’ whereabouts in real time when they’re clocked in and set up digital geofences around job sites to limit the area from which your team can clock in and out.</p>
                        <h3>Automated timesheets</h3>
                        <p>Employee hours are automatically recorded onto digital timesheets for payroll You can easily view and edit all employee hours, if needed, and view overtime, time off, and breaks. The app also flags irregularities, making it easy to spot and fix potentially costly payroll mistakes.</p>
                        <p>On top of that, you can set pay rates per employee and automatically calculate wages.</p>
                        <p>Users can review their timesheets, request any changes, and send in their approval before you process payroll – all via the app. </p>
                        <p>In addition, you can leave comments directly on employee timesheets if you have any questions about their time entries. Connecteam also includes online team chat so you can communicate with employees directly for easy resolutions.</p>
                        <h3>Payroll integrations</h3>
                        <p>Once you’ve approved timesheets, you can simply export them to Excel or one of Connecteam’s payroll integrations: QuickBooks, Gusto, Paychex, and Xero. This way, you can skip the entire manual process and save valuable time processing payroll. </p>
                        <h3>Intuitive drag-and-drop shift scheduler</h3>
                        <p>Connecteam’s free employee scheduling app includes an intuitive drag-and-drop scheduling tool so you can create shifts and simply drag employees’ names to them. You can automatically assign shifts based on employee qualifications, preferences, and availability.</p>
                        <p>The app also offers scheduling templates to make the process even faster. Use Connecteam’s premade scheduling templates or customize your own. You can also create and automatically assign recurring shifts.</p>
                        <p>Additionally, Connecteam has automatic shift conflict alerts that let you know immediately of any scheduling errors. This helps you reduce labor costs by avoiding double scheduling, assigning the wrong employee to a shift, or assigning an employee who’s scheduled for PTO.</p>
                        <p>I absolutely love Connecteam’s auto-scheduler too. With this feature, you can tell the app what shifts you need covered and the app will automatically assign employees to shifts based on availability, preference, and business need.</p>
                        <h3>Shift swapping for seamless coverage</h3>
                        <p>Connecteam allows your employees to trade shifts with just a click of a button. They can request shift swaps directly from the Connecteam app, and you can approve or deny them.</p>
                        <p>Once you approve a shift swap, the app automatically updates the schedule and sends push notifications to anyone whose hours or days have changed.</p>
                        <h3>Plus so much more!</h3>
                        <p>Besides a mobile time clock, Connecteam offers a complete employee management app with tools to manage your business from anywhere. You can communicate with your team, onboard and train new employees, stay on top of task management, and more.</p>
                        <p>Teams of up to 10 people can get Connecteam’s employee scheduling software free for life, and the platform’s paid plan starts at just $29/month for up to 30 users</p>

                        <h3 class="mt-3 mb-0">Clockify — Good for detailed timesheets</h3>
                        <p><a href="https://clockify.me/" target="_blank">Clockify</a> is a clock-in clock-out app that allows workers to track their hours from their phones.</p>
                        <p><b>Why I chose Clockify:</b> Clockify tops the list due to its customizable time tracking features and detailed time tracking reports.</p>
                        <h3>Employee time clock and time tracker</h3>
                        <p>Clocking in and out of work is straightforward with Clockify. Employees can use the clock-in feature to clock in and out of work from their phones, tablets, and desktops, and use the timer to track time spent on specific projects. However, one downside I discovered is that you can’t switch tasks without stopping and restarting the timer in the app. However, you can do this in the kiosk mode.</p>
                        <p>I like that the app comes with GPS, and even takes screenshots of employees’ locations so you can make sure they’re where they’re meant to be while on the clock.</p>
                        <p>Your workers can also add detailed descriptions and tags to each time entry and mark whether the time is billable or non-billable, ensuring that customers pay the correct amount. </p>
                        <p>I also like that you can create different pay scales for projects so that employee pay is calculated correctly on timesheets. </p>
                        <h3>Automated timesheets</h3>
                        <p>Clockify automatically converts employee hours into digital timesheets so neither you or your employees have to manually keep track of them. The app compiles this data into a weekly view, and employees can easily review, edit, and submit their timesheets for approval directly within the platform.</p>
                        <p>It’s also easy for you to review timesheets for proper oversight before sending them to payroll.</p>
                        <h3>Time tracking reports</h3>
                        <p>Clockify provides detailed insights into how time is spent across projects, tasks, and team members. I found that it’s pretty simple to customize these reports to fit your needs. You can select which data you want to include and for which time periods and projects. </p>
                        <p>For example, you can create “team reports” with attendance and assignments and filter them however you need, including start and end time, breaks, work, capacity, overtime, and time off. You can also create expense reports by team, client, project, category, status, and note.</p>
                        <p>These reports provide a visual breakdown of time distribution, and if needed, you can export them in PDF, CSV, or Excel formats.</p>
                        <h3>Integrations</h3>
                        <p>Some of Clockify’s integrations include:</p>

                        <p><a href="https://www.jibble.io/" target="_blank">Jibble</a> is dedicated entirely to time tracking and provides a user-friendly interface for businesses of all sizes.</p>
                        <p><b>Why I chose Jibble:</b> I like how you can customize Jibble based on your needs. It has multiple pricing tiers and even offers a free plan for basic time tracking.</p>
                        <p>I also really like how easy it is to register and get started with the software.</p>
                        <h3>Easy-to-use employee time tracking</h3>
                        <p>Jibble’s employee time clock is simple to use. Employees can clock in and out and track project times via smartphones, tablets, or computers. Whether they’re on-site or in the field, they just press a button in the app to start the clock.</p>
                        <p>I appreciate that Jibble offers three different time tracking policies—flexible, moderate, and strict—each with its own specific settings. These options allow you to tailor the app to match your team’s unique needs and work culture and is perfect for teams with more lenient start and end times to their shifts. </p>
                        <p>If an employee forgets to clock in, the app sends them a notification to remind them to do so, which takes the burden off you so you don’t need to remind employees to do so.</p>
                        <p>I really like that the app offers facial recognition for clocking in and out, which is helpful for accessibility purposes. GPS tracking prevents time theft and ensures employees are at their worksites during work hours. You can also view employees’ locations while they’re clocked in on easy-to-read maps, which are color coded and very clear.</p>
                        <h3>Simplified attendance tracker</h3>
                        <p>I found Jibble’s timesheets and attendance tracking features really user-friendly. The app automatically saves all employee hours onto digital timesheets, which you can review and approve for payroll. I also like that employees can review their own timesheets to ensure accuracy and promote team transparency. However, they do not have access to edit them themselves, which ensures that only admins can do so.</p>
                        <p>Within the app, you can also view employee working hours using daily, weekly, or monthly calendar views. I like how clear they are, and I can see how they are really useful for identifying attendance patterns.</p>

                        <p><a href="https://wheniwork.com/" target="_blank">When I Work</a> is a scheduling and time-tracking app that helps managers build team schedules and track time more easily. It’s ideal for small to medium-sized businesses</p>
                        <p><b>Why I chose When I Work:</b> The app offers real-time GPS and geofencing with time tracking, automated shift scheduling, and seamless integration with payroll systems</p>
                        <h3>Employee time clock and labor reports</h3>
                        <p>Like other similar products, When I Work offers a mobile time clock with GPS tracking that calculates employee hours and automatically records them onto timesheets. I really like that you can set custom limits to how early or late employees can clock in. While testing the software, I was also impressed to see that if an employee misses clocking in, then you’ll receive an immediate notification. </p>
                        <p>One of the app’s standout features related to time tracking is the labor distribution reports. These are really useful for keeping your labor costs in check by providing detailed insights into how labor hours are allocated across different departments, shifts, and tasks. Reports include visual charts and graphs for easy analysis to help you spot trends.</p>
                        <h3>Employee scheduling</h3>
                        <p>When I Work offers an intuitive team scheduler, allowing you to manage everyone’s schedules, time off, overtime, and breaks. </p>
                        <p>When creating schedules, each position is color-coded so you can easily ensure that you have enough of each role scheduled during every shift. Then, you can drag employees’ names to each role to quickly fill them in.</p>
                        <p>If an employee can’t work a specific day, they can give up their shift quickly by filling out a short form. I like that the form requires them to signify whether they are unavailable to work or simply prefer not to work, which gives you better insight into the reason they’re taking off. They can also leave notes for you in this form.</p>
                        <p>Once an employee gives up a shift, other employees with the same qualifications can pick it up from the app on their phones. </p>

                        <p><a href="https://joinhomebase.com/" target="_blank">Homebase</a> is a workforce management app that come with time tracking, hiring and onboarding features, team chat, scheduling, and more.</p>
                        <p><b>Why I chose Homebase:</b> I was impressed with how many tools the app offers and found them all to function nicely. Homebase also offers many useful integrations with popular software.</p>
                        <h3>Time clock and timesheets</h3>
                        <p>I found Homebase’s time clock to be really user-friendly. Employees are able to easily clock in and out using smartphones, tablets, desktops, or even POS systems. However, the photo ID feature is available only on Homebase’s tablet and POS software.</p>
                        <p>The app supports both timer-based and manual entries. Managers can edit entries on timesheets and use GPS tracking and photo verification to prevent time theft and ensure accuracy. </p>
                        <p>The app also provides automatic reminders for clocking in and out and alerts you if employees clock in late or go into overtime. </p>
                        <h3>Time management and scheduling </h3>
                        <p>While testing Homebase’s employee scheduler, I found it really simple to create and copy schedules for recurring use. You can also create your own scheduling templates.</p>
                        <p>The app allows workers to pick shifts, request time off, and swap shifts easily, which can really help reduce scheduling conflicts. You can even set up the app to let workers pick from open shifts based on their own preferences. Additionally, you can set custom policies for time off and breaks to ensure compliance with labor laws. </p>
                        <p>One problematic feature I noticed was that when I logged in as an employee and set a recurring availability preference starting from a future date, the preference took effect immediately rather than from the future date I’d set when I viewed the scheduler as a manager. </p>
                        <p>Homebase also offers an auto-scheduling feature, which generates optimal shift schedules based on labor targets, sales forecasts, and employee availability. </p>

                        <p>Deputy is a time tracking and scheduling software that also offers digital timesheets, task management, communications, compliance support, leave management, and payroll integrations.</p>
                        <p><a href="Why I chose Deputy:">Why I chose Deputy:</a> Deputy provides detailed statistics so you can see how much each employee works and track their hours over time. Thanks to facial recognition and GPS timestamps, employees can also clock in and out touch-free, so timesheets are always accurate.</p>
                        <h3>Employee time clock</h3>
                        <p>Deputy’s employee time clock allows employees to clock in from web browsers, smartphones, and tablets. I was impressed to see that Deputy offers biometric facial recognition and pin codes as clock-in options, which are both useful for accessibility purposes.</p>
                        <p>Another plus is that Deputy’s Kiosk app supports offline functionality. If a job site is located in an area with limited connectivity, the app will store clock-in data for up to 24 hours until the connection is restored.</p>
                        <p>Once an employee clocks in, Deputy tracks their work hours, breaks, and end times and automatically records hours onto employee timesheets. You can also edit timesheets whenever you need from your desktop or mobile phone in case of any errors and export them for payroll using one of Deputy’s payroll integrations.</p>
                        <p>I like that Deputy offers live attendance updates, too, which show real-time information on who has arrived at work, who is on break, and who has clocked out for the day. </p>
                        <h3>Team member journal feature</h3>
                        <p>The Team Member Journal feature is a particularly useful tool within Homebase. It allows you to document notes about employee performance and behavior and keeps a record of both positive feedback and areas needing improvement, which can be useful for performance reviews, coaching, and tracking progress over time. </p>
                        <p>The journal entries are not visible to employees, so the information is documented confidentially and can be referenced whenever you need.</p>
                        <h3>Integrations</h3>
                        <p>Deputy offers integrations with many popular software, including:</p>

                    <h2>What is a Clock-In Clock-Out App?</h2>
                    <p>A clock-in clock-out app is a digital replacement for paper time cards that accurately tracks total time and pay for every pay period. It allows workers to punch in and out from wherever they’re working. This type of app also helps track employees’ locations and hours worked on specific projects or for certain clients. </p>
                    <p>Clock-in and out apps track every type of worker’s hours. For hourly workers, you need to keep track of time to run payroll. For salaried workers, monitoring labor costs and properly charging clients is important. The apps are also flexible enough to track time for freelancers, project-based workers, and deskless and remote employees.</p>
                    <h2>How Does a Clock-In Clock-Out App Work?</h2>
                    <p>Instead of punching physical time cards, employees log into the app. Some enable employees to clock in and out with the press of a button. With others, the app works in the background, automatically keeping track of how much time workers spend on work apps, documents, and in project management systems, without any manual input.</p>
